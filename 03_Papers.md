  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Under what circumstances might providing citizens with information compensate for unreliable public services? We present a field-experimental evaluation of a program that provided households in Bangalore with advance notification of intermittently provided piped water. The implementers expected that increasing service predictability would reduce wait times for water, reduce costs related to waiting, and improve citizen-state relationships. As many citizens did not receive accurate information, our study detected no impacts on household wait times for water or state-citizen relations. Nonetheless, our study suggests that notifications about water timing reduced stress, especially among low income populations. These findings indicate that greater attention should be paid to both psychological outcomes and the information production and dissemination chain in information interventions. We introduce a causal framework for analyzing “information pipelines” to enable such efforts.

## Working Papers

["Home-price subsidies increase local-level political participation in urban India"](june6.pdf) 

[Appendices](Appendices_june6.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Government transfers are becoming increasingly common in low- and middle- income countries. How does receiving transfers affect an important input into ff local governance, namely the propensity to make everyday demands, or claims, of local government? Existing research on these contexts and the US suggests that this relationship could be positive or negative. I study the effects of subsidized home- prices in Mumbai, India through an original survey of winners and non-winners of program lotteries. Benefitting increases reported claims made to improve services and knowledge about municipal government, even among those who rent out the homes. Even where politics is described as a set of exchange-based relationships between officials and citizens, transfers generate active citizenship by increasing the political capacity and changing the motivations of recipients. They also create interest groups at the local level, where such policies are not made, but implemented and experienced. 	 </details>  <br/><br/>   

["Transferring wealth: the human capital effects of subsidizing homeownership"](Kumar_human_capital.pdf) 

[Appendices](Appendices_hc.pdf)
<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Governments often subsidize homeownership, thereby transferring wealth to households. When studying subsidized housing lotteries in Mumbai, I find that beneficiaries reinvest this wealth in human capital. About 3-5 years after the lotteries, winners are more educated and more likely to be employed than non-winners, with large effects concentrated among school-age youth. Effects are unlikely to be driven solely by relocation to areas with better opportunities, as at the time of the survey, winners live in neighborhoods with worse schools, lower rates of literacy, and lower employment rates than non-winners. The results highlight how these illiquid government wealth transfers can shape beneficiaries' long-term economic trajectories in a short time.</details>  <br/><br/>   
  
["From public service access to service quality: The distributive politics of piped water in Bangalore"](https://watson.brown.edu/southasia/files/southasia/imce/events/Spring2018/Postetal.intermittency4.20.pdf) with Alison Post, Megan Otsuka, Francesc Pardo-Bosch, and Isha Ray

  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Infrastructure services such as water, electricity, and mass transit are central to urban livelihoods. While the political economy literature on local public goods provision has examined patterns of expenditure on and access to infrastructure, variation in service quality for those receiving networked services has received far less attention. In this paper, we examine the distribution of service intermittency, which detracts from service quality and imposes significant welfare costs. We disaggregate intermittency into four dimensions: predictability, frequency, duration, and throughput. We extend arguments from the distributive politics literature to predict the allocation of burdens associated with intermittency among households; we show that this literature has paid insufficient attention to how network structures affect the ability of state or city officials to differentially channel service flows. We illustrate the importance of different dimensions of intermittency and network structure through an analysis of the political geography of piped water supply in Bangalore, India. We find that variation occurs at the “valve area” level, or the smallest units at which water pressure can be distributed, and not at the household-level. Households in low-income valve areas receive more frequent and regular service than those in more affluent ones, contrary to predictions from the distributive politics literature. Our work suggests that the distributive politics of network access differ significantly from those affecting water flows within the network.

 ["Preferences for Descriptive Representation: Asymmetries Between Hindus and Muslims in India."](http://sekhon.berkeley.edu/papers/cks_public.pdf) with Pradeep Chhibber and Jasjeet Sekhon 
 <details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
Do minorities have a preference for descriptive representation? We address this question in India, a deeply religious society that has experienced extensive conflict between its Hindu majority and Muslim minority populations. Existing studies of preferences in such settings tend to attribute vote choice to strategic behavior by voters and parties. But because an election is a strategic context, voting outcomes usually reveal not the ideal preferences of voters, but rather their preferences mediated through a political and institutional context. Our research instead seeks to reveal ideal preferences through multiple experiments in diverse strategic settings in India. We find that within and across state lines, Muslims express a preference for co-religious candidates, but Hindus do not. Our findings support the idea that minorities may have a preference for descriptive representation even when it is not strategic to vote for coethnic or co-religious candidates.</details>
