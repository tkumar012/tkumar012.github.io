I am an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Politics and Economics](https://www.cgu.edu/school/ssspe/division-of-politics-economics/) at [Claremont Graduate University](https://www.cgu.edu). I am also a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Effective Global Action](https://cega.berkeley.edu) and a non-resident fellow in the [Program on Governance and Local Development](https://gld.gu.se) at the University of Gothenburg.


 I study the behavior of citizens and bureaucrats in developing contexts. I seek to understand how emerging trends -- the rise of the middle class, new institutions for civic participation, digital inclusion --shape how individuals make decisions. I push past traditional theories of political behavior emphasizing the role of ethnicity, partisanship, and clientelism. I focus instead on actors' capacities, motivations, and agency. 
 
 My work combines original data collection, design-based causal inference, and qualitative fieldwork to shed light on understudied or difficult-to-study phenomena. My regional expertise is in India.


I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I have been named a Susan Clarke Young Scholar by APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section.
