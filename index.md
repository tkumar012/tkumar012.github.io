I study the political, economic, and social behavior of individuals living in low- and middle-income countries, particularly India. To date, I have focused on policies related to urban water supply, housing, access to digital technology, civic participation, and rural employment. I am also interested in statistics and research methodology.

 Beginning in August 2020, I will be a Digital Technology and Development Fellow at [William and Mary's Global Research Institute](https://www.wm.edu/offices/global-research/). I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I hold an MA in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley and a BA in Government and Economics from Bowdoin College.
