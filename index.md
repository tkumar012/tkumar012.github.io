I am a postdoctoral fellow at [William & Mary's Global Research Institute](https://www.wm.edu/offices/global-research/). Starting July 2022, I will be an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Politics and Economics](https://www.cgu.edu/school/ssspe/division-of-politics-economics/) at [Claremont Graduate University](https://www.cgu.edu). 


I study urban politics and political behavior, mainly in India. I seek to understand the effects of policies aimed at managing rapid urban growth. I focus on how policy both shapes, and is shaped by, the behavior of citizens and local-level officials. 

 My research is forthcoming or published in the *Journal of Politics*, the *Journal of Development Economics*, and *World Development.* Check out some media coverage of this work in [The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/01/31/heres-what-gavin-newsom-elizabeth-warren-and-microsoft-should-know-if-want-to-end-the-affordable-housing-crisis/?tid=sm_tw_cage), [The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/mhada-home-winners-see-upswing-in-family-edu-pay-in-mumbai-study/articleshow/86468320.cms),  and this [podcast](https://www.discoursemagazine.com/politics/2020/12/24/ideas-of-india-how-does-subsidizing-housing-prices-shape-political-behavior/). 



I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I also studied at Bowdoin College. I have been named a Susan Clarke Young Scholar and won a Best Dissertation Award (Honorable Mention) from APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section.
