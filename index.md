Today, over half of the world's population lives in cities. While low- and middle-income countries remain predominantly rural, the 2014 United Nations World Urbanization Prospects report predicts that urbanization will add 2.5 billion people to the global urban population by 2050. In India alone, cities are expected to grow by over 400 million residents during this time period. 

I study how policies to house and provide essential services to this growing population shape, and are further shaped by, the behavior of urban citizens and politicians. My primary regional focus is on India, but I am also studying cities in the United States and Eastern Africa. I am pursuing this agenda through  projects that combine insights from political science, development economics, and public policy to generate policy-relevant insights on the factors shaping the lives of urban residents across the globe.


I am a Digital Technology and Development Fellow at [William and Mary's Global Research Institute](https://www.wm.edu/offices/global-research/).I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I also hold an MA in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley and a BA in Government and Economics from Bowdoin College.
