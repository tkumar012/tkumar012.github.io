I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I am interested in the determinants of political, economic, and social behavior of individuals living in developing countries, particularly India. I also have an active interest in statistics and research methodology.

My dissertation project seeks to understand the role of property ownership in the political behavior of low-income residents of Mumbai, Maharashtra. This project has been generously supported by the [J-PAL Governance Initiative](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/GI), the [Weiss Family Program Fund in Development Economics](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/wfrde), and the [Institute of International Studies at UC Berkeley](https://iis.berkeley.edu).

Additionally, I am working on projects involving water intermittency in Bangalore and attitudes towards quotas in Uttar Pradesh. 

I am also an avid distance runner and endurance eater.
