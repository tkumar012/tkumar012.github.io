Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I am interested in the determinants of political, economic, and social behavior of individuals living in developing countries, particularly India. I also have an active interest in statistics and research methodology.

My dissertation project seeks to understand the role of property ownership in the political behavior of low-income residents of Mumbai, Maharashtra. This project has been generously supported by the [J-Pal Governance Initiative](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/GI), the [Weiss Family Program Fund in Development Economics](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/wfrde), and the [Institute of International Studies at UC Berkeley](https://iis.berkeley.edu).

Additionally, I am working on projects involving water intermittency in Mumbai, attitudes towards quotas in Uttar Pradesh, mobilization on the basis of religious identity across India, and the relationship between power and cluster size in cluster-randomized experiments. You can find more information about these projects and my teaching, mentorship, and work experience on my [CV](http://clickmeterlink.com/utix).

I am also an avid distance runner and endurance eater.
