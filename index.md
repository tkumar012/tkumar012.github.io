I am an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Politics and Economics](https://www.cgu.edu/school/ssspe/division-of-politics-economics/) at [Claremont Graduate University](https://www.cgu.edu). 


I study political, economic, and social behavior in low- and middle-income countries. How do citizens' material circumstances affect the choices they make and how they interact with each other in society? What are the consequences of emerging global trends to change these fundamentals?  I'm particularly interested in the effects of policies related to housing and digital technology. My regional expertise is in urban India.

I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I have been named a Susan Clarke Young Scholar and won a Best Dissertation Award (Honorable Mention) from APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section. 

I am co-organizing a workshop on Urban Politics in the Global South. Learn more [here](https://www.globalsouthurbanpols.com)!
