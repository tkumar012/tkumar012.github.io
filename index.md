I am a PhD Candidate in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley. I am interested in the determinants of political, economic, and social behavior of individuals living in developing countries, particularly India. I also have an active interest in statistics and research methodology.

My dissertation project seeks to understand how welfare programs in developing countries fundamentally change the way in which individuals make demands of the government. In particular, I study the political and economic effects of an affordable housing program in Mumbai, Maharashtra. This project has been generously supported by the [J-PAL Governance Initiative](https://www.povertyactionlab.org/GI), the [Weiss Family Program Fund in Development Economics](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/wfrde), and the [Institute of International Studies at UC Berkeley](https://iis.berkeley.edu).

You can pronounce my name THUH-noo or tuh-NOO (like "canoe"), your preference.

I am also an avid distance runner and endurance eater.
