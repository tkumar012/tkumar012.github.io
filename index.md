I am an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Politics and Economics](https://www.cgu.edu/school/ssspe/division-of-politics-economics/) at [Claremont Graduate University](https://www.cgu.edu). I am also a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Effective Global Action](https://cega.berkeley.edu).


Citizens almost universally feel that their national-level governments are out of touch with their needs. How can individuals create change in their own communities? 

 I study the behavior of citizens and bureaucrats in everyday politics at the local-level, a political arena that has become much more important in the last twenty years. Currently, I study how growth in three areas, namely housing policies, new or understudied modes of civic participation, and digital inclusion can amplify citizen voice. My regional expertise is in urban India.

I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I have been named a Susan Clarke Young Scholar and won a Best Dissertation Award (Honorable Mention) from APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section. 

I am co-organizing a workshop on Urban Politics in the Global South. Learn more [here](https://www.globalsouthurbanpols.com)!
