 I am a Governance Specialist in the World Bank's Public Institutions and Data Analytics Unit. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Politics and Economics](https://www.cgu.edu/school/ssspe/division-of-politics-economics/) at [Claremont Graduate University](https://www.cgu.edu), a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Effective Global Action](https://cega.berkeley.edu), and a non-resident fellow in the [Program on Governance and Local Development](https://gld.gu.se) at the University of Gothenburg.


My research examines how citizens and states negotiate governance under conditions of constrained capacity. I  work across multiple domains: housing, water, urbanization, and digital accountability. This cross-cutting approach generates new theoretical insights about bureaucratic responsiveness, institutional capacity, and social mobility, while also producing evidence that is directly relevant to policymakers who face interconnected governance challenges. In short, my agenda seeks to bridge disciplines, methods, and sectors to develop a  holistic understanding of how governance works in practice.

I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I have been named a Susan Clarke Young Scholar by APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section. 

I co-organize an annual conference on urban politics in the global south. Check it out [here!](https://www.globalsouthurbanpolitics.com)
