I am an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Politics and Economics](https://www.cgu.edu/school/ssspe/division-of-politics-economics/) at [Claremont Graduate University](https://www.cgu.edu). I am currently a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Effective Global Action](https://cega.berkeley.edu) and  was a non-resident fellow in the [Program on Governance and Local Development](https://gld.gu.se) at the University of Gothenburg in 2023.


I study how everyday citizens can improve governance in India. I focus on when they will make demands along with the conditions under which government officials, particularly those who are not usually elected, will respond. I rely on field studies, primary data collection, qualitative methods, and creative strategies for causal inference to shed light on the potential for social accountability in contexts where existing research would suggest its prospects seem weak. 

I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I have been named a Susan Clarke Young Scholar by APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section. 

I co-organize an annual conference on urban politics in the global south. Check it out [here!](https://www.globalsouthurbanpols.com)
