I am an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Politics and Economics](https://www.cgu.edu/school/ssspe/division-of-politics-economics/) at [Claremont Graduate University](https://www.cgu.edu). I am also a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Effective Global Action](https://cega.berkeley.edu) and a non-resident fellow in the [Program on Governance and Local Development](https://gld.gu.se) at the University of Gothenburg.


 I study the behavior of citizens and bureaucrats in everyday politics at the local-level, a political arena that has become much more important in the last twenty years. I move past traditional theories emphasizing the role of ethnicity, partisanship, and clientelism. I focus instead on the capacities, motivations, and agency of individuals. I seek, broadly, to understand what citizens want, how they communicate their needs with officials, and what motivates or inhibits the response of those in government.
  
 I explore these issues by measuring citizens' reactions and adaptations to  the expansion of three policy areas, namely housing, new or understudied modes of civic participation, and digital inclusion. All of my work combines original data collection, design-based causal inference, and qualitative fieldwork to shed light on understudied or difficult-to-study phenomena. My regional expertise is in urban India.


I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I have been named a Susan Clarke Young Scholar by APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section.
