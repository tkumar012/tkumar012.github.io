 I am a Governance Specialist in the World Bank's Public Institutions and Data Analytics Unit. Previously, I was an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Politics and Economics](https://www.cgu.edu/school/ssspe/division-of-politics-economics/) at [Claremont Graduate University](https://www.cgu.edu), a faculty affiliate at the [Center for Effective Global Action](https://cega.berkeley.edu), and a non-resident fellow in the [Program on Governance and Local Development](https://gld.gu.se) at the University of Gothenburg.


I study governance from the perspective of citizens, bureaucrats, and their interactions. My policy expertise is in water, housing, and urbanization in India. My academic research relies on field studies, primary data collection, qualitative methods, and creative strategies for causal inference to shed light on the potential for government accountability in contexts where existing research would suggest its prospects seem weak. 

I completed my PhD in Political Science at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2020. I have been named a Susan Clarke Young Scholar by APSA's Urban and Local Politics Section. 

I co-organize an annual conference on urban politics in the global south. Check it out [here!](https://www.globalsouthurbanpols.com)
