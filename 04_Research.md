My research seeks to understand the origins and consequences of civic engagement in low- and middle-income countries, particularly India. Much of the literature on politics here focuses mainly on electoral behavior and preferences; nevertheless, citizens routinely engage in everyday local political activity including complaint-making, negotiation with bureaucrats, and even participation in planning and budgeting processes. When and why will they do so, and how do their actions affect governance?

My dissertation project first seeks to understand causes of local-level political participation. I argue that welfare programs are vehicles for redistributing wealth and substantially changing the lives of beneficiaries. Their effects on economic wellbeing should, in turn, translate to changes in political preferences and behavior, particularly by generating demands to improve aspects of governance that may affect the new wealth. My findings to support this argument in India show that government policies can themselves generate demands for development and change in a context often understood through the lenses of clientelism and co-ethnic voting. My next major project will study how this participation affects governance and service provision in both urban and rural India.

My work is based on rigorous quantitative methodology, fieldwork, and primary data collection, all of which have been made possible by my extensive training in statistics and research design. Nevertheless, field-based research routinely raises new challenges in measurement, implementing interventions, and understanding mechanisms. Addressing these problems forms another important strand of my research agenda. 

### Dissertation 

My dissertation, titled “Building civic engagement through redistribution: The sustained political and economic effects of social welfare on households in India,” explores how India’s many welfare programs affect local-level political participation. Existing literature, seeking to explain motivations for creating programs such as cash transfers and employment guarantees, has focused primarily on whether they generate electoral rewards for implementers. Yet everyday political participation, such as complaint-making and negotiation with bureaucrats and politicians, remains a cornerstone of political behavior in low- and middle-income countries. Where officials have an incentive to be responsive, this activity can lead to real improvements in governance and service provision at the local level. 

The project is centered around the idea that many types of welfare programs, such as pensions, work guarantees, or affordable housing, either deliver streams of benefits or are used by recipients over a sustained period of time. Programs that cumulatively transfer large benefits have the potential to change citizens’ time horizons, attitudes, and motivations. I argue that beneficiaries will be particularly motivated to protect the value or quality of their benefits. For example, recipients of disability programs may demand more timely payments, or those participating in an employment guarantee program may wish to influence the types of projects on which they work. The benefits themselves facilitates the demand-making activity by making recipients wealthier and decreasing the opportunity cost of their time. If complaint-making to protect the value of group welfare benefits is seen as a collective action problem, welfare transfers increase both the benefit and decrease the cost of participation. In other words, as discussed by scholars of the United States, policies can have important feedback effects. With this scholarship as a starting point, I develop and empirically support an argument focused on local civic engagement because in settings where governing responsibilities are decentralized, local bodies play an important role in implementing programs.

I first illustrate these dynamics through a natural experiment, a lottery-based affordable housing program in Mumbai. This portion of the project combines qualitative fieldwork and an original survey that entailed tracking down and surveying 1,000 applicants of multiple housing lotteries 3-5 years after program implementation. These affordable housing programs entail large benefits that are likely to have a substantial impact on the economic lives of beneficiaries. Indeed, I find that the program increases household wealth, optimism about the future, time horizons, educational attainment, and rates of employment among beneficiaries. 

In line with the theory, these programs also affect beneficiaries’ political behavior at the local level. Unlike ration cards or employment programs wherein the government is clearly responsible for maintaining the value of benefits, the lottery homes entail the one-time delivery of a benefit for private ownership. But as local-level service provision to neighborhoods of even privately-owned homes remains a public function, I argue that recipients will seek to protect the value of their benefits by demanding that local governments better the communities in which homes are located. I find that winning an apartment increases both reported political participation to improve neighborhoods and knowledge about local politics. Winners who choose to rent out the apartments also report taking action to improve neighborhoods in which they own apartments but do not live, suggesting that effects are not the result of social pressure alone. 

After establishing the micro-foundations of my argument, I test it on two other welfare programs in India, the National Social Assistance Program (NSAP, a pension program for the elderly and disabled), and Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY, a health insurance program for the poor). I use two waves of nationally representative household survey and a differences-in-differences strategy to look at the effects of NSAP on reported local political participation. Finally, my argument operates under the scope condition that while policies may be unevenly implemented, benefits do eventually reach citizens and change their economic outcomes. I use the same panel of household-level survey data and another difference-in-differences strategy to explore the economic and political effects of RSBY, a program that has largely failed to help its intended beneficiaries due to poor targeting and problems with insurance markets. 

###Future extensions

For my future work, I plan to investigate how increased civic engagement actually affects governance and service provision.  Existing research tends to highlight elite capture and co-ethnic favoritism when discussing patterns of service allocation; during my time in India, I learned that while such patterns may exist, motivated citizens can effectively place pressure on bureaucrats and local representatives to respond to their demands. To systematically study this phenomenon, I will use qualitative evidence from fieldwork in urban and rural parts of India to illustrate what local level political participation looks like for an average citizen. I will also include a depiction of both citizens’ and officials’ perceptions of when and how governments respond to complaints. I will complement this qualitative work with text analyses of minutes from village meetings and an original dataset I have collected of every public complaint made in Mumbai over the course of five years alongside government responses to these complaints. 

Another portion of this agenda will address the role of welfare programs in the monitoring of corruption. The dissertation project suggests that some citizens, namely welfare beneficiaries, may care more about local-level corruption than others. Recently, several have investigated (with mixed results) the effectiveness of many interventions providing citizens with information about corruption on a variety of outcomes, including turnout, vote choice, and monitoring. I am currently working on an empirical project that will reanalyze several of these experiments and test whether treatment effects are particularly strong among welfare beneficiaries.  

###Research on methodology

These substantive research projects aside, my experience with field-based and experimental research have and will continue to inspire projects on research methodology. For example, Alison Post, Isha Ray, and I were motivated by an information based- field experiment to write a tutorial (published in World Development) on ensuring that information-based field interventions reach their intended beneficiaries. Another paper with Alison Post, Megan Otsuka, Francesc Pardo-Bosch, and Isha Ray highlights the importance of collecting data about the boundaries of local units of service distribution when trying to understand the factors that vary with public service quality in urban India. Yet another working paper with Pradeep Chhibber and Jasjeet Sekhon highlights the role of multiple case selection when trying to learn about the electoral preferences of different groups. In a current project borne out of attempts to disentangle mechanisms in my dissertation project, I claim that mechanisms in experiments are missing data problems and discuss concrete ways to approach this challenge.
