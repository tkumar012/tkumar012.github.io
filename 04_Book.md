## Housing as Welfare
### How government-supported homeownership generates social mobility through wealth, voice, and dignity in India

Governments can help their citizens find shelter in a number of different ways, but I argue that there is something unique about helping households purchase a large, durable asset that they can keep, rent, or sell as they wish. This ownership helps even the poorest households build wealth, exercise their voice as citizens, and live with dignity--in both rural and urban areas. Government subsidized homeownership is, in short, a powerful tool for social mobility. 
This book explores the idea of housing as welfare. The comparison highlights the role housing can take in a government's portfolio of policies, but it also broadens notions about what welfare programs can be and what they can accomplish.
