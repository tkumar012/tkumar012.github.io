## Housing as Welfare
### How subsidized homeownership generates social mobility through wealth, voice, and dignity in India

Governments can help their citizens find shelter in a number of different ways, but there is something unique about helping households purchase a large, durable asset that they can use, rent, or sell as they wish. The support housing provides to families is in-kind, but when it is owned and can easily be bought or sold, its benefits approach those of pure income transfers. The flexibility and certainty with which citizens can consume these transfers gives them a degree of agency and control over their lives, especially in relationship to the actions of others. This agency, or what I call dignity, in turn, emboldens citizens to make demands of their local government, especially as they seek to advance their own interests and protect the value of their new homes. 


 I argue that subsidized homeownership helps even the poorest households build wealth, exercise their voice as citizens, and live with dignity--in both rural and urban areas. As I trace out how the policy shapes different aspects of citizen behavior, I also illustrate how wealth and dignity shape civic participation, ideas that are relatively unexplored in the literature on political behavior in LMICs.
		
This book explores the idea of housing as welfare.  It highlights the economic and political role housing can take in a government's portfolio of policies, but also broadens notions about what welfare programs can be and accomplish. The widespread implementation of subsidized homeownership, moreover, suggests that transfers made through housing may be more politically expedient than something like a basic income guarantee.
